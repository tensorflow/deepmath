Before compiling any files in the ZZ framework, you need to do the following:

  - Set your path to include 'ZZ/BUILD' or, alternatively, make an alias 'zb'
    to point to 'ZZ/BUILD/zb'.

  - Make sure you have Python version 2.6 or 2.7 installed.

  - Make sure you have developer header files installed for 'libz'.

Now you can compile any binary by going into the appropriate directory, e.g.
'ZZ/HolLight', and typing 'zb'. Most binaries are put into 'zz/bin/<machine>',
but some "debug" binaries are put into the local directory. This is determined
by the contents of 'MODULE.conf' in each directory (where a '@' in front of the
name in the 'PUBLISH_BIN' line indicates a local installation). For more
information on the 'zb' tool, see ZZ/BUILD/build_system.txt'.
